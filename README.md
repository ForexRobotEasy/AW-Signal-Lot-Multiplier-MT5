# AW Signal Lot Multiplier MT5

This code is an Expert Advisor (EA) for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) that allows you to automatically open duplicate orders based on trading signals received from a trading signal provider. The EA subscribes to trading signals and when a new signal is received, it calculates a new volume for the order based on a lot multiplier value and opens a new order with the calculated volume.

## Prerequisites

To use this code, you need to have the following libraries and resources installed:

- Trade.mqh
- PositionInfo.mqh
- AccountInfo.mqh
- SymbolInfo.mqh
- TradeSignal.mqh

## Constants

This code defines the following constants:

- `TAKE_PROFIT`: The desired take profit for the orders opened by this EA.

## Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is the expert initialization function. In this function, trading is enabled by setting the expert magic number and deviation in points. The EA also subscribes to trading signals using the `SubscribeToSignal()` function.
